# Building-AI-Visually-Assist
AI-Based Image Text Extraction and Text-to-Speech Conversion
This project combines advanced AI-driven capabilities for text extraction from images, scene understanding, and text-to-speech (TTS) conversion. It demonstrates the power of computer vision, natural language processing, and speech synthesis in creating accessible and dynamic content.

Features
Text Extraction from Images: Utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images with high accuracy.
Scene Understanding: Describes the visual scene and elements in an image, providing contextual understanding.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: Converts the extracted or generated text into natural-sounding speech, improving accessibility.
Technologies Used
OpenCV: For image processing and scene understanding.
Tesseract OCR: For text extraction from images.
PyTorch/TensorFlow: For building and training models for image and text processing.
gTTS/pyttsx3: For converting text to speech.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing results and model outputs.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
pip (Python package installer)
Step-by-Step Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Ram0067/ai-image-text-to-speech.git
cd ai-image-text-to-speech
Install the required dependencies: You can install the required Python libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or manually install:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python pytorch tensorflow tesseract pyttsx3 gtts matplotlib seaborn
Download the necessary models (e.g., Tesseract, pre-trained deep learning models, etc.) and place them in the appropriate directories as required by the code.

Run the script: Use the following command to run the main script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will process the images in the input_images/ directory and output the extracted text and audio files in the output/ directory.

Usage
Text Extraction from Image:
Upload your image into the input_images/ folder. The system will process the image, extract the text using Tesseract OCR, and display it.

Scene Understanding:
The model will analyze the image, providing a brief description of the scene.

Text-to-Speech:
The extracted text will be converted to speech and saved as an audio file in the output/ directory. You can play the audio file to hear the content.
